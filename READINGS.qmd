### PURPOSE: What Drives Meaning in Life?

### EMOTION: Regulation and Differentiation

Understanding how we manage our emotional responses is central to many of the psychological phenomena depicted in our films. Recent research highlights the importance of *emotion differentiation*—the ability to make fine-grained distinctions between emotional states.

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Key Readings

**Kashdan, T. B., Barrett, L. F., & McKnight, P. E.** (2015). Unpacking emotion differentiation: Transforming unpleasant experience by perceiving distinctions in negativity. *Current Directions in Psychological Science, 24*(1), 10-16. [Read](https://www.jstor.org/stable/44318822){target="_blank"}

- Key review showing that people who differentiate emotions with high granularity are less likely to resort to maladaptive strategies (binge drinking, aggression, self-harm) when distressed.

**Kalokerinos, E. K., Erbas, Y., Ceulemans, E., & Kuppens, P.** (2019). Differentiate to regulate: Low negative emotion differentiation is associated with ineffective use of emotion-regulation strategies. *Psychological Science, 30*(6), 863-879. [Read](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26957266){target="_blank"}

- Experience-sampling study demonstrating that low emotion differentiators use regulation strategies less effectively—all strategies are associated with *increased* negative emotion for them.

**Feldman Barrett, L., Gross, J. J., Conner Christensen, T., & Benvenuto, M.** (2001). Knowing what you're feeling and knowing what to do about it. *Cognition & Emotion, 15*(6), 713-724. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1080/02699930143000239){target="_blank"}

### MOTIVATION: Social Dominance and Power

What drives people to seek power over others? How do social hierarchies shape behavior?

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Key Readings

### UNCERTAINTY: Deception and Detection

Can we really tell when someone is lying? These readings challenge common assumptions about deception detection.

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Key Readings

**Vrij, A., Hartwig, M., & Granhag, P. A.** (2019). Reading lies: Nonverbal communication and deception. *Annual Review of Psychology, 70*, 295-317. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-010418-103135){target="_blank"}

[DOI](https://doi.org/10.1037/per0000226){target="_blank"}
