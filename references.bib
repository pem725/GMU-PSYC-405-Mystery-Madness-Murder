	abstract = {This paper offers an epistemological discussion of self-validating belief systems and the recurrence of epistemic defense mechanisms and immunizing strategies across widely different domains of knowledge. We challenge the idea that typical "weird" belief systems are inherently fragile, and we argue that, instead, they exhibit a surprising degree of resilience in the face of adverse evidence and criticism. Borrowing from the psychological research on belief perseverance, rationalization and motivated reasoning, we argue that the human mind is particularly susceptible to belief systems that are structurally self-validating.},
