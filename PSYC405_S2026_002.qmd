## WHAT: Course Description/Overview

PSYC 405 (Mystery, Madness, and Murder) fulfills requirements for **Mason Apex** in Mason Core. What that means can be better explained via their [website](https://masoncore.gmu.edu/){target="_blank"}. For us, I want you to wonder. Ever wonder how psychology can be applied in every aspect of your life? Not pop psychology but real psychological science? Some stuff out there is real and real common. We will observe both factual and fictional depictions of human behavior, dissect the behavior according to science, and discuss the results of our collective inquiry. We will learn and apply psychological science together. My aim is to work with you to create a course you fondly recall for many years. Let's do it together. How? Well, you need to know what is expected...

## DEMANDS: Course Learning Outcomes

::: {.callout-important}
## The Mason Apex course objectives are:

Integrate skills, abilities, theories, or methodologies gained across a Mason student's undergraduate education to explore complex issues in original ways. Communicate effectively the results of the student's work with awareness of audience, purpose, and context using an appropriate modality (for example: written, oral, visual, material, embodied, multimodal).
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon="lightbulb"}
## Your Cognitive Arsenal

What that means to you is that the fifteen weeks of twice-weekly sessions ought to lead you to the following additions to your cognitive arsenal. You will be MORE able to...

-   **Detect** human behavior

-   **Appreciate** the limits of our detection Integrate your observations with theory

-   **Understand** behavior in everyday life

-   **Apply** your gained knowledge to evaluate both fictional and non-fictional stories

We will be on an unscripted odyssey of wonder and learning. Join me!
:::

## HOW: What are we going to do?

We are going to critically and psychologically analyze popular media portrayals of humans. Each week, we meet on Monday and Wednesday morning. Come prepared to listen and watch. Our goal is to capture observations, think critically, and discuss the material as it relates to several "governing" areas of inquiry.

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Governing Areas of Inquiry

1.  **BELIEF:** Why do people believe weird things? When are they more likely to believe in such oddities? Can we predict who believes odd stuff? Do I believe odd stuff?
2.  **PURPOSE:** What will people do to protect their own beliefs, defend their own principles, or die for honor?
3.  **MOTIVATION:** What drives people to do amazing, cruel, helpful, selfless, or selfish acts?
4.  **UNCERTAINTY:** What would you be willing to do to change the most uncomfortable situation? Have you ever been so uncertain about something that you couldn't sleep?
5.  **DISCOMFORT:** What would you be willing to do to make your (or another person's) life more comfortable?
6.  **EMOTION:** To what extent do humans behave emotionally (vs. rationally)? Why would this matter?
:::

These are the central themes that we will revisit each week. Some may be more relevant than others given the topic at hand. Be aware that you ought to search for the relevance in all. Each of these areas has a wealth of scientific evidence that keeps us still searching for more. In other words, the evidence is there but it is wanting. Along this path of enrichment, we will explore and apply good scientific discipline to understand the nature of human behavior. Each section of the course (Mystery, Madness & Murder) provides us with a unique look across the various sub-disciplines of psychological science.

### Media & Schedule

During class, we shall all share in the viewing of a media snippet that depicts a person in context behaving either as a recreation of "real" behavior or as a fictional account of behavior. Our goal is to dissect the behavior, identify the validity of such acts, understand the author/director's intent, and appreciate the behavior in context.

## Quiz Questions & Study Materials
All quiz questions are available for study on our [Quiz Page](QUIZZES.qmd). Yes, you can see the questions beforehand! The goal is for you to **learn** how questions are constructed and how psychological science connects to film content. The questions require integration of movie knowledge AND readings - simple memorization won't help.

## Official Communications via GMU E-mail
Mason uses electronic mail to provide official information to students. Examples include communications from course instructors, notices from the library, notices about academic standing, financial aid information, class materials, assignments, questions, and instructor feedback. Students are responsible for the content of university communications sent to their Mason e-mail account, and are required to activate that account and check it regularly. If you are having your Mason mail forwarded to another account, please ensure that your Mason account doesn't exceed the assigned limit, causing mail to bounce back to the sender.

## Disability Accommodations
If you are a student with a disability and you need academic accommodations, please let me know early in the semester. If you have not already done so, contact the Office of Disability Services (ODS) at 703-993-2474. All academic accommodations must be arranged through that office. Please keep in mind that it might not be possible to grant last-minute requests for accommodations, so it is important to make all arrangements well before the date when the accommodation is needed. The Office of Disability Services website can be found at http://ods.gmu.edu

## Academic Integrity
The integrity of the University community is affected by the individual choices made by each of us. Mason has an Honor Code with clear guidelines regarding academic integrity. Three fundamental principles to follow at all times are: (1) all work submitted must be your own; (2) when using the work or ideas of others, including fellow students, give full credit through accurate citations; and (3) if you are uncertain about the ground rules on a particular assignment, ask for clarification. No grade is important enough to justify academic misconduct. More information on Mason's Honor Code can be found at http://oai.gmu.edu/the-mason-honor-code-2/

## TL;DR - The Bottom Line

Show up to your section, watch a (part of a) movie, complete the weekly quiz ***after paying attention***, and speak up during discussion in class or online (not during the movie). Do that, you earn an A. Anything short of that is negotiable.
