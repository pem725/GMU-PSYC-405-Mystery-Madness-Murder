**Critical - Students cannot answer quiz questions without this content:**

1. **Gross's (2015) Emotion Regulation Framework** (ESSENTIAL)
   - Five strategies: situation selection, situation modification, attentional deployment, cognitive reappraisal, response modulation
   - Explain how Teddy's delusion = extreme SITUATION MODIFICATION
   - Key distinction: He doesn't reinterpret reality (reappraisal); he creates NEW reality

2. **Therapeutic Approaches to Delusion**
   - Dr. Cawley's "role-play" approach is controversial
   - Research suggests reinforcing delusions can strengthen them
   - Discuss ethical concerns with the experimental treatment

3. **Trauma Memory vs. Ordinary Memory**
   - Flashbacks have "here and now" quality (timeless)
   - Trauma memories resist narrative integration

   - Teddy's conspiracy theory explains AWAY contradictory evidence
   - The bigger the evidence against him, the bigger the conspiracy

5. **Reconstructive Memory**
   - Memory is NOT a video recording
   - Brain takes true fragments and reconstructs false narratives
   - Teddy has real elements (Dachau, wife, water) woven into fiction

#### Discussion Questions to Prompt
- "What evidence would convince YOU that you're delusional?"

#### Quiz 6 Concepts (MUST COVER)

   - LOW differentiation = can't distinguish anxiety types
   - Nina can't tell productive striving from self-destruction
   - All anxiety feels the same → can't self-regulate effectively
   - "Enough" vs. "too much" becomes indistinguishable

2. **Low Differentiation and Symptom Progression (Kalokerinos et al., 2019)**
   - Key finding: Low differentiators struggle with ALL regulation strategies
   - Even adaptive strategies (like reappraisal) backfire
   - Nina tries everything (distraction, suppression) → nothing works
   - Each failed attempt may worsen symptoms

3. **Identity Fusion and Autonomous Purpose**
   - Erica lives vicariously through Nina
   - Nina's goals aren't truly HERS (non-self-concordant)
   - Pursuing someone else's dream makes self-regulation harder
   - McKnight & Kashdan (2009) on autonomous vs. imposed purpose

4. **Literal vs. Figurative Interpretation**
   - Thomas: "Lose yourself" (metaphor for emotional access)
   - Nina: Interprets LITERALLY (actual identity dissolution)

**Critical forensic psychology concepts:**

1. **Psychopathy and Moral Understanding (Marshall et al., 2018)** (ESSENTIAL)

   - Psychopaths often UNDERSTAND morality but are UNMOVED by it
   - Aaron knows murder is wrong (constructs elaborate defense)
   - He understands what's convincing (fakes DID)
   - Problem is moral MOTIVATION, not moral KNOWLEDGE

2. **Social Dominance Orientation (Pratto et al., 1994)**

   - Defense work APPEARS hierarchy-challenging
   - But can serve hierarchy-enhancing goals
   - SDO can manifest through any career path

3. **Deception Detection (Vrij et al., 2019)** (ESSENTIAL)

   - This explains how Aaron fools everyone

4. **Mens Rea and Diminished Capacity (Morse, 1992)**
