### Class 3 - Wednesday, January 28
**Time:** 10:30-11:45 AM

#### Topics to Cover
1. **Film Viewing** (45 min)
   - Continue The Machinist to completion (46 min remaining)

2. **Discussion on Guilt and Reality** (25 min)
   - The revelation: hit-and-run accident
   - Ivan as externalized guilt
   - How guilt can manifest physically and psychologically

#### Quiz 2 Concepts (MUST COVER BEFORE QUIZ)
**Critical - Students cannot answer quiz questions without this content:**

1. **Sleep Deprivation and Reality Monitoring** (ESSENTIAL)
   - Reality monitoring = distinguishing internal from external experiences
   - Sleep loss specifically impairs this ability
   - Trevor's hallucinations of Ivan = failed reality monitoring
   - Can't tell imagination from reality

2. **Gross's (2015) Emotion Regulation - Situation Selection/Construction**
   - Trevor creates Ivan as alternative psychological SITUATION
   - Not reappraisal (reinterpreting existing events)
   - He constructs an entirely NEW situation to inhabit
   - Pathological situation selection - creating false reality

3. **Self-Validating Beliefs (Boudry & Braeckman, 2012)**
   - Delusions can serve protective functions
   - Processing unbearable truth through symbolic displacement
   - Ivan allows guilt processing without conscious acknowledgment
   - The delusion "explains" his distress without requiring responsibility

4. **Apophenia - Pattern Perception**
   - Trevor interprets random events (hangman game, license plates) as meaningful
   - Apophenia = perceiving patterns in random data
   - Enhanced by emotional distress AND sleep deprivation
   - His mind seeks explanation → finds "messages" everywhere

5. **Emotion Differentiation (Kashdan et al., 2015)**
   - Trevor experiences intense negative affect but can't identify source
   - Low differentiation: Is it guilt? Fear? Shame? Anxiety?
   - Can't distinguish → can't target specific emotion for regulation
   - All negative feelings blur together

#### Discussion Questions to Prompt
- "If guilt is so unbearable, why doesn't the mind just forget?"
- "What cues eventually broke through Trevor's self-deception?"
- "How does the body respond when the mind tries to suppress truth?"

## Section 002 Unique Themes

### Mystery Module: Unreliable Narrators Trilogy
All three Mystery films feature protagonists whose perception of reality is fundamentally unreliable:
- **The Machinist**: Guilt creates hallucination
- **Identity**: Entire narrative is inside one person's mind
- **Fight Club**: Protagonist doesn't know part of himself

This creates a throughline students can track and compare.

### Madness Module: Atypical Minds and Hope
- **Rain Man**: Autism portrayed (1988 lens)
- **K-PAX**: Is it delusion or something else?
- **Leaving Las Vegas**: What happens without hope?

Students confront different relationships to hope and recovery.

### Murder Module: Systems and Individual Responsibility
- **Nuremberg**: State apparatus enabling genocide
- **Wind River**: Government neglect enabling violence

Both examine how systems - through action or inaction - enable harm.
