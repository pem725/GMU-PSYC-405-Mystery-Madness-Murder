# Teaching Notes - CONFIDENTIAL

This directory contains instructor-only teaching notes for PSYC 405.

**DO NOT SHARE WITH STUDENTS**

These files are:
- ✅ Tracked in git (for backup and version control)
- ❌ NOT published to the website (not in `_quarto.yml` render list)
- ❌ NOT uploaded to Canvas

## Contents

- `TEACHING_NOTES_S2026_001.md` - Section 001 teaching notes
- `TEACHING_NOTES_S2026_002.md` - Section 002 teaching notes

## What's Included

Each teaching notes file contains:
1. **Full semester schedule** with all class dates
2. **Topics to cover** for each session
3. **Quiz concepts that MUST be discussed** before students take quizzes
4. **Discussion questions** to prompt engagement
5. **Key readings** mapped to each week
6. **Instructor reminders** for logistics

## Usage

Before each class:
1. Review the relevant class session notes
2. Check which quiz concepts need to be covered
3. Prepare discussion questions
4. Queue film to correct timestamp

## Privacy Verification

These files are excluded from website publication because:
- `_quarto.yml` uses an explicit `render:` list
- `teaching_notes/` is NOT in that list
- Only explicitly listed files are rendered

To verify: Run `quarto render` and check that no files appear in `_site/teaching_notes/`
