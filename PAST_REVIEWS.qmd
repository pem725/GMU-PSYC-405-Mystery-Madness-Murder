## What Students Say

### What Students Valued Most

::: {.callout-tip icon="false"}

> — Spring 2025 Student
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon="false"}

> — Fall 2025 Student

> *"Professor McKnight connected the films we watched to relevant, interesting psychological concepts."*
> — Fall 2025 Student

> *"The class discussions as a class were amazing. I do remember a lot of deep conversations that were often steered back to the movie. The instructor was very good at relating psychological principles in the movie back to real life."*
> — Spring 2025 Student
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon="false"}
## Personal Impact

### Constructive Feedback & Suggestions

::: {.callout-warning icon="false"}
## Requests for More Structure

> *"I think we needed more written or hands on assignments. Even just 5 or 6 would have been helpful, or an end of year assignment, metacognition, anything where we could have picked out our favorite movie and written about it."*
> — Spring 2025 Student

> *"There were not many assignments, so most topics were learned from discussion which did not provide as much practice or application."*
> — Fall 2025 Student

> *"We did not have any course work besides minimal quizzes. I wish the class was a little more structured."*
> — Fall 2025 Student
:::

::: {.callout-warning icon="false"}
## Schedule Clarity

> *"A little clearer communication on what days we will have quizzes (not a big deal but it is something to consider)."*
> — Fall 2025 Student

> *"A clear schedule of when movies will be played / when discussions will be had regarding the movie."*
> — Fall 2025 Student
:::

::: {.callout-warning icon="false"}
## One Dissenting Voice

> *"I understand Patrick does not follow teaching in the old fashioned way (readings, slides, exams) but honestly that is how I have been learning so far... those points that were talked about in class were not stored in my long term memory because even if I tried to take notes, it was hard because they were dialogues."*
> — Spring 2025 Student

*Note: This represents a minority view. The discussion-based, film-centered approach is intentional and valued by most students, but may not suit every learning style.*

## Course Philosophy & Response to Feedback

### Why This Course Looks Different

This course is intentionally **not** a traditional lecture-based class. As a **Mason Apex** capstone course, the goal is to integrate skills across your undergraduate education through critical analysis, discussion, and synthesis—not memorization of facts.

The discussion-based approach and minimal traditional assignments are **by design**:

- **Films as texts**: Movies provide shared experiences for psychological analysis
- **Discussion over exams**: Real understanding emerges through articulation and debate
- **Attendance-based grading**: Presence and engagement matter more than test performance
- **Low-stakes environment**: Reduces anxiety, encourages risk-taking in thinking

### Addressing Common Concerns

| Concern | Response |
|---------|----------|
| "Need more assignments" | The course now includes **discussion questions** for each film to provide guided reflection points. Weekly quizzes remain low-stakes but reinforce key concepts. |
| "Schedule unclear" | The syllabus now includes detailed week-by-week schedules with specific film assignments and quiz weeks clearly marked. |
| "Hard to take notes on discussions" | The new **Film Resources & Discussion Questions** section provides pre-reading prompts tied to course themes (Belief, Purpose, Motivation, Uncertainty, Discomfort, Emotion). |
| "Traditional learners struggle" | This is acknowledged. Students who prefer lecture/exam formats may find other courses more suitable. This course rewards presence and participation. |

- **100%** of Fall 2025 respondents expected to receive an A
- Multiple students explicitly stated they **recommended the course to friends**

### Who Should Take This Course

This course is ideal for students who:

- Enjoy discussion and expressing their perspectives
- Want to apply psychology to real-world (and fictional) scenarios
- Appreciate a relaxed, engagement-focused learning environment
- Are comfortable with minimal traditional assignments

This course may be challenging for students who:

- Strongly prefer structured lecture/exam formats
- Need written assignments to encode information
- Are uncomfortable participating in class discussions

---

## Obstacles Beyond Instructor Control

When asked about obstacles to learning beyond the instructor's control, students overwhelmingly reported **none**:

- "There were no obstacles with this class, this teacher always had open communication"
- "No, not at all this course was magnificent"
- "No significant obstacles to learning"

The only external factors mentioned were personal (commuting, illness) rather than course-related.
