## Quiz 12: Wind River (2017)

*This quiz requires knowledge of the film AND relevant psychological science.*

---

### Question 1

Wind River depicts violence against Indigenous women, a crisis that receives minimal mainstream attention. According to Boudry et al. (2015), why might this issue remain "invisible" despite extensive documentation?

A) The crisis is not actually serious
B) Media coverage has been adequate
C) Beliefs about which lives matter are socially transmitted; issues affecting low-status groups may fail to achieve the salience required for widespread attention and action
D) Indigenous communities prefer privacy

### Question 2

Cory Lambert tracks predators both literally (as a hunter) and figuratively (as an investigator). According to Gross (2015), how might this dual role function as emotion regulation?

A) Hunting and investigation are unrelated activities
B) Both activities channel grief and rage into controlled, purposeful action - a form of response modulation that transforms overwhelming emotion into directed behavior
C) Lambert has no emotional investment in either activity
D) Violence always represents failed regulation

### Question 3

FBI Agent Banner initially underestimates the reservation environment. According to research on belief formation (Shermer, 2002), what does her learning curve illustrate?

A) FBI training is inadequate
B) Urban agents cannot work rural areas
C) Prior beliefs based on different contexts (urban crime, federal jurisdiction) led to initially incorrect expectations - updating these beliefs required direct contradictory experience
D) Banner is uniquely ignorant

### Question 4

The film reveals that Natalie died running for help after being assaulted at a drilling camp. According to emotion research (Kashdan et al., 2015), what does the medical examiner's difficulty in classifying her death illustrate?

A) Medical examiners lack training
B) Systemic categories (homicide, exposure) may fail to capture deaths caused by multiple factors - just as low emotion differentiation fails to distinguish between multiple emotional causes of distress
D) Classification is always straightforward

---

### Question 5

The film ends without cathartic revenge - the surviving perpetrator is given "a fighting chance" to freeze to death. According to McKnight & Kashdan (2009), why might Lambert choose this ambiguous justice over clear execution?

A) Lambert lacks the capacity for violence
B) The choice is random without psychological meaning
C) Allowing the perpetrator to experience what Natalie experienced may serve Lambert's purpose more than simple revenge - justice through experiential symmetry rather than death
D) Lambert is legally prohibited from killing
