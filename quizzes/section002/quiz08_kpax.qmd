## Quiz 8: K-PAX (2001)

*This quiz requires knowledge of the film AND relevant psychological science.*

---

### Question 1

The film deliberately maintains ambiguity about whether Prot is an alien or a man with trauma-induced delusion. According to Shermer (2002), why might viewers PREFER the alien explanation despite its implausibility?

A) Alien explanations are scientifically more defensible
B) Viewers are unintelligent
C) The alien explanation is more emotionally satisfying and cognitively simpler than the complex trauma narrative - characteristics that make beliefs "sticky"
D) Psychiatric explanations are always wrong

---

### Question 2

Prot describes K-PAX as a planet without families, laws, or violence. According to research on belief systems (Boudry & Braeckman, 2012), what psychological function might this utopian vision serve?

A) Accurate memory of alien society
B) Random confabulation without meaning
C) A self-validating alternative reality that provides escape from the trauma of his actual life - the "K-PAX" belief immunizes against unbearable earthly truths
D) Deliberate deception of the psychiatrist

---

### Question 3

The other psychiatric patients improve when interacting with Prot. According to emotion research (Gross, 2015), what mechanism might explain this effect?

A) Prot has supernatural healing powers
B) Mental illness spontaneously remits
C) Prot provides a form of cognitive reappraisal - his alternative perspective helps patients reinterpret their situations, and his apparent belief models hope
D) The patients are faking improvement

---

### Question 4

Dr. Powell eventually uncovers evidence that "Prot" may be Robert Porter, a man whose family was murdered. According to Kalokerinos et al. (2019), how might trauma contribute to identity fragmentation?

A) All trauma survivors develop alternate identities
B) Trauma has no effect on identity
C) Low negative emotion differentiation following trauma may make adaptive processing impossible, leading to maladaptive strategies including dissociation and identity transformation
D) Only childhood trauma affects identity

---

### Question 5

Prot claims he will return to K-PAX at a specific time, and another patient disappears at that moment. The film does not resolve whether this is coincidence, suggestion, or proof of alien nature. According to Matthews (2005), what does this ambiguity illustrate about "rational" belief?

A) The audience should conclude Prot is definitely an alien
B) The audience should conclude Prot is definitely human
C) Given ambiguous evidence, multiple interpretations can be rationally defended; "irrationality" often reflects different prior beliefs rather than cognitive defects
D) The film's ambiguity is a narrative flaw
