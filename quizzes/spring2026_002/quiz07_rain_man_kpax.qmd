## Quiz 7: Transition - Diagnosis and Uncertainty

*This quiz bridges Rain Man and K-PAX.*

---

### Question 1

Both Raymond (Rain Man) and Prot (K-PAX) present diagnostic challenges. According to Matthews (2005), why might clinicians rationally disagree about unusual presentations?

A) Psychiatric diagnosis is purely subjective
B) Clinicians are randomly distributed in diagnostic tendencies
C) Given ambiguous evidence, different prior beliefs (base rate expectations) lead to different rational conclusions - "weird" presentations challenge standard diagnostic inference
D) Only one diagnosis can ever be correct

---

### Question 2

Raymond's savant abilities are genuine; Prot's claimed alien origin may or may not be delusional. According to Vrij et al. (2019), what makes distinguishing delusion from reality so difficult in Prot's case?

A) Aliens might actually exist
B) Behavioral cues cannot distinguish between sincere belief (delusion) and deliberate deception - and genuine delusion produces no "deception" cues at all
C) Psychiatrists lack training in alien detection
D) Prot deliberately obscures diagnostic cues

### Question 3

Both films explore how "different" minds relate to "normal" society. According to Pratto et al. (1994), how might social dominance orientation predict attitudes toward both Raymond and Prot?

A) High SDO would predict acceptance of difference
B) SDO is irrelevant to attitudes about neurodiversity
C) High SDO correlates with preference for hierarchy; unusual minds may be seen as threats to social order or as requiring institutionalization rather than accommodation
D) Low SDO individuals reject all difference

### Question 4

Dr. Powell (K-PAX) becomes personally invested in Prot's case. According to research on emotion differentiation (Kashdan et al., 2015), what risk does this personal investment create?

A) Investment always improves clinical judgment
B) Personal feelings have no effect on diagnosis
C) Undifferentiated emotional investment may impair objective assessment; distinguishing professional concern from personal fascination requires high emotion differentiation
D) Only detached clinicians make accurate diagnoses

### Question 5

Charlie transforms from exploiting Raymond to genuinely caring for him. According to McKnight & Kashdan (2009), this transformation illustrates which characteristic of purpose as a "self-organizing system"?

A) Purpose is externally imposed by circumstances
B) Purpose creates conditions that sustain and strengthen itself - Charlie's initial positive experiences with Raymond generated further investment that became self-perpetuating
C) Purpose develops independently of experience
D) Purpose cannot emerge from selfish beginnings
