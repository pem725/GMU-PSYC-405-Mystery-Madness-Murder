### Question 2

Sera agrees not to ask Ben to stop drinking. According to research on purpose (McKnight & Kashdan, 2009), what does this acceptance represent?

A) Healthy unconditional love
B) Standard codependency without complexity
C) Sera's acceptance may reflect her own disrupted purpose system - lacking direction for herself, she organizes around Ben's death rather than challenging it
D) Optimal therapeutic support

### Question 3

A) Purpose can only be developed once
B) Career success is required for purpose
C) Purpose requires some degree of positive emotional experience; profound anhedonia and depression may prevent the happiness that facilitates purpose formation
D) Ben has chosen purpose-rejection deliberately

---

### Question 4

The film refuses to offer hope for Ben's recovery. According to Boudry & Braeckman (2012), why might audiences find this refusal uncomfortable despite its realism?

A) Audiences are inherently optimistic
B) The film is poorly made
C) We have self-validating beliefs about redemption narratives; stories without hope violate these schemas and create cognitive dissonance
D) All films should have happy endings

---

### Question 5

Ben and Sera form a genuine connection despite his self-destruction. According to emotion differentiation research (Kashdan et al., 2015), what does their relationship suggest about intimacy and emotional granularity?

A) True connection requires sobriety
B) Their relationship is not genuine
C) Moments of differentiated emotional experience (tenderness, gratitude, acceptance) can exist alongside chronic dysregulation - connection does not require overall emotional health
D) Alcoholism enhances emotional connection
