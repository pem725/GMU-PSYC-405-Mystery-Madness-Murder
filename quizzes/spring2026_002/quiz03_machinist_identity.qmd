## Quiz 3: Transition - Fragmented Selves

*This quiz bridges The Machinist and Identity.*

---

### Question 1

Both Trevor Reznik and Malcolm Rivers (Identity) experience fragmented identity, but the films portray this differently. What is the KEY diagnostic distinction?

A) Trevor is psychotic; Malcolm is neurotic
B) Trevor's fragment is external hallucination; Malcolm's fragments are alternate personalities
C) Trevor creates one externalized guilt projection; Malcolm's "personalities" are portrayed as separate identities within one mind - the latter represents dissociative identity disorder
D) Only Malcolm's condition is real; Trevor is simply sleep deprived

---

### Question 2

Identity depicts dissociative identity disorder (DID) with multiple distinct "alters." According to current scientific understanding, what does the film get MOST wrong about DID?

A) DID never involves multiple personalities
B) Trauma is unrelated to DID
C) DID rarely presents with dramatically distinct personalities aware of each other; the "host knows nothing" trope is cinematically convenient but clinically uncommon
D) DID cannot involve violence

---

### Question 3

In Identity, psychiatrists attempt to "integrate" Malcolm's personalities by eliminating the dangerous ones. According to research on belief systems (Boudry & Braeckman, 2012), what problem does this approach face?

A) Integration is always impossible
B) Dangerous personalities cannot be eliminated
C) The assumption that "bad" alters can be simply removed reflects a self-validating belief about treatment that may not match the complexity of dissociative systems
D) Only medication can treat DID

---

### Question 4

Both films use unreliable narration - viewers cannot trust what they see. According to Shermer (2002), how does this narrative technique parallel the psychology of belief?

A) Unreliable narration is simply a storytelling trick
B) Viewers are too easily deceived
C) Just as film viewers construct coherent narratives from incomplete information, people construct beliefs from limited evidence and resist revising them even when contradicted
D) Unreliable narration prevents psychological analysis

---

### Question 5

Trevor eventually confesses to the police, achieving relief. Malcolm's "cure" is ambiguous (the surviving personality may also be murderous). According to McKnight & Kashdan (2009), what does Trevor's confession achieve that Malcolm's treatment does not?

A) Legal punishment as moral cleansing
B) Authentic integration of traumatic experience into identity, allowing purpose and meaning to resume - versus continued fragmentation
C) External validation of innocence
D) Nothing - both outcomes are equally therapeutic
