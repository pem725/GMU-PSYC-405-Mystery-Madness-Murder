A) Cognitive reappraisal of relationship value
B) Situation selection that avoids emotional contexts entirely
C) Expressive suppression of positive emotions
D) Attentional deployment toward threat cues

### Question 2

Will's foster father burned him with cigarettes, yet Will questions whether he "deserved" the abuse. According to Boudry and Braeckman (2012), why might abuse victims develop self-blaming beliefs despite evidence to the contrary?

A) Children lack cognitive capacity to assign blame appropriately
B) Self-blame provides an illusion of control and predictability
C) Self-validating belief systems develop where self-blame is more psychologically tolerable than acknowledging complete powerlessness
D) Abusers explicitly teach victims to accept blame

---

### Question 3

Sean shares his own pain with Will (his wife's death, his imperfections). According to research on therapeutic relationships, why does this self-disclosure succeed where previous therapists failed?

A) Professional boundaries should always be violated in effective therapy
B) Shared suffering creates automatic rapport
C) Will needed to feel superior to his therapist
D) The disclosure models emotional differentiation - acknowledging multiple simultaneous feelings - and demonstrates that vulnerability does not equal weakness

---

### Question 4

Lambeau wants Will to use his mathematical genius for prestigious careers. Will resists, eventually choosing to pursue Skylar to California. According to McKnight et al. (2025), what does this choice suggest about the relationship between purpose and happiness?

A) Will sacrifices purpose for happiness
B) Intellectual purpose is less valid than relational purpose
C) Happiness (connection with Skylar) may be facilitating his emerging sense of purpose rather than competing with it
D) Will's choice demonstrates purpose avoidance

---

### Question 5

Will can solve complex mathematical proofs but cannot solve his own psychological problems. This dissociation illustrates which limitation in the "smart people believe weird things" phenomenon (Shermer, 2002)?

A) Mathematical intelligence differs from emotional intelligence
B) Intellectual sophistication enables rationalization of emotional avoidance, making smart people more effective at constructing defenses
C) Genius exempts people from normal psychological processes
D) Will's problems are too complex for anyone to solve
