## Quiz 7: Transition - Madness and Therapy

### Question 2

A) Artistic purpose is superior to interpersonal purpose
B) Purpose can only develop through professional achievement

D) Purpose requires integration of multiple life domains; Nina's exclusive focus on ballet and Will's avoidance of intimacy both represent fragmented rather than integrated purpose

B) External recognition invalidates internal purpose
