## Overview

Weekly quizzes test your integration of **film content** AND **psychological science**. These are not simple recall questions - they require you to connect what you observe in films with the theoretical frameworks from our [course readings](READINGS.qmd).

::: {.callout-tip}
## Study Strategy

The questions are intentionally difficult. To succeed:

1. **Watch actively** - Don't just enjoy the film; analyze character behavior through our governing areas of inquiry
2. **Read the literature** - Our [Zotero library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/6375337/psyc_-mystery_madness_murder/library){target="_blank"} contains the psychological science you'll need
3. **Connect film to theory** - Each question bridges a specific film moment with a psychological concept
4. **Understand distractors** - Wrong answers are designed to be appealing; they represent common misconceptions
