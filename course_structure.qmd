## Mystery Block

### Weeks 2-3: Diabolique {#diabolique}

We start here because Diabolique shows how easily beliefs can be manipulated—and how we fall for it.

#### Key Sources and Applications

Diamond's[@diamond1961] work on psychiatric examination pairs well with the film's perception-versus-reality tension. Shermer[@shermer2002, @shermer2003] helps explain why the characters believe what they believe.

#### Learning Activities

Students analyze the film using Shermer's[@shermer2003] fallacies and apply Trocco's[@trocco, @trocco1998] methods for studying "weird phenomena." This analysis focuses primarily on the governing areas of **Belief** and **Uncertainty**.

### Weeks 4-5: Hoodwinked! {#hoodwinked}

How does who's telling the story change what we believe?

#### Key Sources and Applications

Vrij et al.[@vrij2019] on deception detection helps us analyze the multiple perspectives in the film. Shermer[@shermer2003] on media manipulation fits the film's narrative structure.

#### Learning Activities

Students examine deception methods and narrator reliability using Vrij's[@vrij2019] concepts, focusing on **Belief**, **Uncertainty**, and **Emotion** as governing areas.

## Madness Block

### Weeks 6-7: A Beautiful Mind {#beautiful-mind}

What happens when you can't trust your own mind? Nash's story raises hard questions about diagnosis and treatment.

#### Key Sources and Applications

-   Geller's[@geller1998] analysis of "crazy therapies" and their potential harm
-   Diamond's[@diamond1961] perspective on psychiatric examination methods
-   Gross's[@gross2015] framework for emotion regulation stages

#### Learning Activities

Students apply emotion regulation concepts to character analysis and evaluate treatment approaches through both Geller's[@geller1998] and Diamond's[@diamond1961] perspectives.

### Weeks 9-10: Jacob's Ladder {#jacobs-ladder}

What's real when trauma rewrites your experience?

#### Key Sources and Applications

-   Geller's[@geller1998] concept of "bogusness" in relation to altered realities
-   Diamond's[@diamond1961] rehabilitation and treatment perspectives
-   Gross's[@gross2015] emotion regulation in psychopathology

#### Learning Activities

Students analyze rehabilitation approaches and apply Gross's[@gross2015] emotion regulation model to the protagonist's experiences.

## Murder Block

### Weeks 11-12: The Hound of the Baskervilles {#hound}

Fear spreads through stories. The Baskerville legend shows how superstition takes root.

#### Key Sources and Applications

-   Shermer's[@shermer2003] analysis of societal fear feedback loops
-   Marshall's[@marshall2018] moral foundations theory
-   Trocco's[@trocco, @trocco1998] skeptical perspective methodology

#### Learning Activities

Students compare the Baskerville legend to Shermer's[@shermer2003] "witch craze" concept and analyze characters through moral foundations theory.

### Weeks 13-14: Murder by Death {#murder}

When everyone's a detective, whose version of events do we trust?

#### Key Sources and Applications

-   Marshall's[@marshall2018] work on psychopathy and moral decision-making
-   Diamantis's[@diamantis2015] concept of "collective knowledge"
-   Vrij's[@vrij2019] research on deception detection training

#### Learning Activities

Students apply collective knowledge doctrine to the detective group and analyze deception detection abilities.
